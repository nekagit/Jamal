      Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world. The longer you 
      live, the more you realize that the only things that truly exist in this reality are 
      merely pain, suffering and futility. Listenâ€¦ Everywhere you look in this world, 
      wherever there is light, there will always be shadows to be found as well. As long
       as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also exist. The selfish intent 
       of wanting to preserve peace initiates wars and hatred is born in order to protect love. 
       There are nexuses, causal relationships that cannot be separated.
